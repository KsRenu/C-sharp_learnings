        3. Perform basic operations on numbers in c#
        4. Call methods from .NET class library using C#
        5. Adding decision logic to the code
        6. Arrays and foreach
        7. Conventions, comments and witespaces
        8. Boolean expressions
        9. Variable scope and logic using code blocks
        10. Branching - switch case
        11. Iteration - for loop
        12. Iteration - do-while and while loop
        13. Data types
        14. Casting and Conversion techniques
        15. Array operations using helper methods
        16. Alpha numeric data for presentation
        17. Strings and in-built functions of strings


Sample codes implemented and outputs for the following questions: 

        1.Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.
        
        2.Write a function that takes an integer minutes and converts it to seconds.
        
        3.Create a function that takes a number as an argument, increments the number by +1 and returns the result.
        
        4.Create a function that takes voltage and current and returns the calculated power.
        
        5.Write a function that takes the base and height of a triangle and return its area.
        
        6.Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments (num, length) and returns an array of multiples of num until the array length reaches length.
        
        7.Create a function that takes an array of arrays with numbers. Return a new (single) array with the largest numbers of each.
        
        8.ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits. Your task is to create a  function that takes a string and returns true if the PIN is valid and false if it's not.
        
        9.Create a function that determines whether elements in an array can be re-arranged to form a consecutive list of numbers where each number appears exactly once.
        
        10.Given an integer, create a function that returns the next prime. If the number is prime, return the number itself.
